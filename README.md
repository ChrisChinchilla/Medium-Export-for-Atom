# Medium Export

Export your Markdown files to Medium, simple.

At the moment the plugin will export your markdown files to Medium, it uses the first level 1 heading as a post title, and assume that it is correctly formatted.

You will need to create an integration token [here](https://medium.com/me/settings) and add it to the plugin settings page.

This is an early beta, so there might be some problems, please feel free to open issues and make pull requests with feature and problem ideas. And I am new to Coffeescript and Atom development, so be kind :)

## Road Map

- [ ] Remove boilerplate code
- [ ] Also handle HTML files
- [ ] Images (Probably works with images hosted elsewhere)
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Check files actually are Markdown / HTML
- [ ] Error handle
- [ ] Display a popup with resulting post link
- [ ] Allow for more configuration of posts
- [ ] Updates to posts
